Bootup / autorun options
========================

-------
syshook
-------

Veritawall offers an easy method to plug in custom scripts during boot stages and assorted system events.

Syshook scripts should be installed in:

::

    /usr/local/etc/rc.syshook.d/<subdir>/

They can contain any executable file (e.g. shell scripts) in the following subdirectories:

- backup
    - scripts used for periodic backup and restore
- carp
    - scripts used for CARP MASTER / BACKUP events
- config
    - scripts used when a configuration change took place (:code:`config.xml` changed).

.. Note::
    This event is intended to be atomic for every changed revision, it's triggered using configd :code:`system event config_changed`
    and is loosely coupled via a :code:`syslog-ng` handler within the standard :code:`Config->save()` method.
    The syshook event contains a pointer to the backup file in question (e.g. :code:`/conf/backup/config-1601651332.5394.xml`),
    so the consumer (script) knows which revision to process.

.. Tip::
    Try to keep custom config handlers as small and efficient as possible since the number of triggered events can grow rapidly.

- early
    - start script before system network startup
- monitor
    - scripts handling gateway monitoring alerts
- start
    - start script after system network startup
- stop
    - stop script before normal system shutdown
- update
    - update script after core package update (post-update)
- upgrade
    - upgrade script migration tool for major upgrade (pre-upgrade)

File names can use a number prefix "XX-" to retain a particular order.  "20-" is typically used for core scripts, while "50-" is used for plugins.

Example (vmware guestd start, filename /usr/local/etc/rc.syshook.d/early/50-vmware)

::

    #!/bin/sh

    export vmware_guest_vmblock_enable="YES"
    export vmware_guest_vmhgfs_enable="YES"
    export vmware_guest_vmmemctl_enable="YES"
    export vmware_guest_vmxnet_enable="YES"

    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/vmware-kmod start

Do not forget to set executable permissions on your syshook files.

-----
rc(8)
-----

Part of the bootup process of Veritawall is probing the available rc(8) configuration files in */etc/rc.conf.d/*, when a daemon is enabled, the system will call the regular rc(8) start command.

In case the daemon needs some extra preparation, an additional "bootup" script can be provided, which will be run before executing normal "start".

Example (from a configured squid proxy server using */etc/rc.conf.d/squid*):

::

    squid_enable=YES
    squid_veritawall_bootup_run="/usr/local/veritawall/scripts/proxy/setup.sh"


The configd template system can be used to generate the necessary configuration file(s).
