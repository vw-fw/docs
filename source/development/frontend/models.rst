Creating Models
===============

A model represents the data which the application will use and takes
care of the interaction to that data. In Veritawall most of the relevant
data is physically stored in an XML structure (config.xml). The primary
goal for Veritawall models is to structure the use of configuration data,
by creating a clear abstraction layer.

In this chapter we will explain how models are designed and build.
