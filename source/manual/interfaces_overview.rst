Overview
=========================

The interfaces overview contains an extended version of `ifconfig <https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ifconfig>`__
that's available on most systems.

You can use this page to check the current assigned addresses, interface status, link status and other details.

When an interface is configured using DHCP, you can also reload/release an address here.
