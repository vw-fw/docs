Password
====================================

The password page in the lobby offers the user the ability to change his or hers password and default settings.

When The option :code:`User OTP seed` is enabled in the :menuselection:`System->Settings->Administration` page, one could also
acquire a new OTP seed here.

.. Warning::

    Changing an OTP seed automatically invalidates the previous one, so only request a new one when you are able
    to scan the new one using your mobile phone.
