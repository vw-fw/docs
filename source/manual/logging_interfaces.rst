Log Files
==============

When troubleshooting problems with your firewall, it is very likely you have to check
the logs available on your system. In the UI of Veritawall, the log files are generally grouped
with the settings of the component they belong to. The log files can be found here:

==================== ============================================================== ===================================================================
 **Wireless**         :menuselection:`Interfaces --> Wireless --> Log File`         *When using wireless features of Veritawall you find the logs here*
 **Point-to-Point**   :menuselection:`Interfaces --> Point-to-Point --> Log File`   *PPP dialup logs like PPPoE are found here*
