=============
Caching Proxy
=============

.. image:: images/forward_proxy.png

Veritawall is equipped with a fully featured forward caching (transparent) proxy.
A caching proxy reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and
reusing frequently-requested web pages. The Access Control Lists can be utilized
for user authentication and or as (category based) web filter.

Features include:

* Multi Interface Support
* Transparent Mode (including SSL/HTTPS)
* ICAP Support for Anti Virus/Malware Engine
* HTTP Proxy
* FTP Proxy
* User Authentication
* Access Control Lists (valid for both http(s) and ftp)
* (Compressed) Blacklist
* Category Based Web Filtering
* Can be combined with traffic shaper

--------------
Authenticators
--------------
User authentication can be done using Veritawall standard and built-in authenticators.
Currently these include:

* LDAP (incl. Microsoft Active Directory)
* Radius
* Local user manager
* No authentication

These options can be found in the :menuselection:`Web Proxy -> Administration -> Forward Proxy -> Authentication Settings` section.

--------------
Access Control
--------------
Veritawall supports fine grained access control, which can be configured in :menuselection:`Web Proxy -> Administration -> Forward Proxy -> Access Control List`
containing the following (Advanced) options:

* Subnets
* Ports
* MIME types
* Banned IPâ€™s
* Whitelists
* Blacklists
* Browser/User Agents


------------------
Traffic Management
------------------
The proxy can be combined with the traffic shaper and take full advantage of its
shaping features. Additionally it includes its own options:

* Maximum download size
* Maximum upload size
* Overall bandwidth throttling
* Per host bandwidth throttling

These options can be found in the :menuselection:`Web Proxy -> Administration -> General Proxy Settings -> Traffic Management Settings` section.


-------------------------
Category Based Web Filter
-------------------------
No need for additional plugins, such as squidGuard - as Veritawall has built-in
category based web filter support. Main features include:

* Fetch from a remote URL
* Supports flat file list and category based compressed lists
* Automatically convert category based blacklists to squid ACLs
* Keep up to date with the built-in scheduler
* Compatible with most popular blacklist

----------------
Transparent Mode
----------------
The transparent mode means all requests will be diverted to the proxy without any
configuration on your client. Transparent mode works very well with unsecured http
requests, however with secured (SSL) HTTPS connection the proxy will become a
man-in-the-middle as the client will "talk" to the proxy and the proxy will encrypt
the traffic with its master key that the client is required to trust.

.. Warning::
    Using a transparent HTTPS proxy can be a dangerous practice and may not be
    allowed by the services you use, for instance e-banking.


------------
WPAD And PAC
------------
If a transparent proxy cannot be used, Veritawall still supports automatic proxy
configuration via WPAD / PAC.

.. Warning::
    WPAD via DNS requires the web interface to run on the default HTTP port
    (TCP/80) which is also a security risk (MITM attacks). In such cases you
    should proxy the connection or avoid configuring the applicance from an
    untrusted network.

-----------------------
Custom error pages
-----------------------

Error pages can be customized for your own needs.
In order to do so, go to :menuselection:`Web Proxy -> Administration -> General Proxy Settings` and select "Custom" in "User error pages",
after which an additional tab will be visible named "Error Pages".

.. raw:: html

    Go to this tab and use the top download <i class="fa fa-download fa-fw"></i> icon to receive a zip file containing
    all available error pages and associated cascading style sheets.
    <br/><br/>
    After altering the files, zip them again and upload using the file selector option  <i class="fa  fa-folder-o fa-fw"></i> on the same tab
    followed by the upload button  <i class="fa fa-upload fa-fw"></i>.
    <br/><br/>
    The reset <i class="fa fa-fw fa-remove"></i> button can be used to remove your custom template from the configuration, after
    which the download option would return the standard Veritawall template.


There are some rules to take into account when creating custom themed error pages:

* extend the :code:`errorpage.css` file to theme your pages
* make sure error pages don't require anything else than css, images should be converted to base64 and provided inline.
  Not only is this faster to handle than separate image files it also prevents rendering issues in case images can't be accessed.
* only existing error pages will be processed, if filenames won't match, the files won't be written to disk. you can use the download button
  to inspect what's being deployed (it will return a combined set of custom and standard files)
* it's best not to include files that are not altered, this saves room in the configurartion and prevents defauls from being overwritten.

.. Tip::

    If you only want to change the background image, it's usually enough to upload the css file in a directory and leave out all the html files.

.. Tip::

    To convert images to inline base64 tags, there are quite some online tools available, which can easily be found using google.
    As an example, our logo can be found in the the css file looking like :code:`background: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,PD9...) no-repeat left;`
