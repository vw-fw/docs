Routes
=========

Routing is one of the core features of your firewall, which is responsible for forwarding packets over the network
based on (predefined) paths.

Within the routing section of your firewall you can keep track of configured routes and define static routes
yourself to teach your firewall which path it should take when forwarding packets to a specific network.



.. blockdiag::
   :desctable:

   blockdiag {
      client [shape="cisco.pc", label="[1]"];
      Veritawall [shape="cisco.firewall", label=""];
      internet [shape="cisco.cloud"];
      private_net [shape="cisco.cloud", label=""];
      private_net2 [shape="cisco.cloud", label="[2]"];
      Gateway1 [shape="cisco.router", label=""];
      Gateway2 [shape="cisco.router", label="[3]"];
      client -> Veritawall;
      Veritawall -> Gateway1 -> internet;
      Veritawall -> Gateway2 -> private_net;
      Veritawall -> Gateway2 -> private_net2;

      group {
          label = "Client";
          color = none;

          client;
      }

      group {
        label = "Veritawall";
        color = none;

        Veritawall;
      }

      group {
          label = "Gateways";
          color = none;

          Gateway1 ;
          Gateway2 ;
      }

      group {
          label = "Networks";
          color = none;

          internet;
          private_net;
          private_net2;
      }
   }


When a client sends a packet to the firewall for a network not directly attached to it, the firewall would
normally check its routing table to determine to which gateway (see :doc:`/manual/gateways`) it should be send.


.. Tip::
    Use traceroute (:menuselection:`Interfaces --> Diagnostics --> Trace Route`) to verify which path traffic would
    follow to reach its destination.

----------------------
Configuration
----------------------

This is where you can setup static routes, looking at the diagram in the previous chapter, here you would define how
:code:`[1]` would access :code:`[2]` using router :code:`[3]`.

The number of settings are obviously limited, we need to know the gateway and the target network.

.. Note::
    Some services are known to update the routing table themselves, in which case you shouldn't add static routes
    manually (OpenVPN manages its own routes for example).


----------------------
Status
----------------------


The status page shows the current active content of the routing table.

===========================================================================================================

============================= =============================================================================
Proto                         Protocol (IPv4 or IPv6)
Destination                   Destination network
Gateway                       Where to send the packet for this destination network
Flags                         Routes have associated flags which influence operation of the protocols
                              when sending to destinations matched by the routes.
                              See the **Flags** table below for details.
Use                           Counts the number of packets sent via this route
MTU                           The MTU set for this route
Netif                         Interface to use for this route
Netif (name)                  Name of the interface if found
Expire                        The time at which this route should expire, or zero if it should	never expire.
                              It is the responsibility of individual protocol suites to	ensure that routes are
                              actually deleted once they expire.

Logs

Route related logging, like :code:`radvd` and :code:`rtsold` for IPv6 write messages to this logging section
which can be used for debugging purposes.
