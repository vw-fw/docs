Relations with Veritawall
-----------------------
Veritawall is built on top of FreeBSD. The aim of the Veritawall team is to stay as
close to the original source as possible. Veritawall can be installed on
a standard FreeBSD installation, this way a hosted system can be converted
easily to run Veritawall. A bootstrap script is available to make the installation
process a joyful experience.

  To convert your FreeBSD hosted installation to Veritawall, see the Veritawall
  bootstrap script on `Veritawall's update tools @ github <https://github.com/opnsense/update/>`__
